# CSC-285/Lab-12  (Due Monday Dec.12 by 11:59pm)

Twelth assignment for CSC 285

Sunset App Ver 1.0
---
Property Animation

## Objectives:
This week's lab is aimed at familiarizing yourselves with Android's high-level HTTP networking. You are going to create a new app called PhotoGallery that is a client for the photo-sharing site Flicker. It will fetch and display the most recent public photos uploaded to Flickr.  

## Overview:
In this lab, you will create a new Repository in your GitHub CSC-285 organization account and name it **PhotoGallery-UserName**. You will start building a new application named PhotoGallery in Android Studio. Almost all day-to-day programming of web services these days is based on the HTTP networking protocol. You will learn how to fetch, parse, and display photo captions from Flicker. You will also learn how to use Looper, Handler, and HandlerThread to dynamically download and display photos in PhotoGallery.

## Implementation Notes:
