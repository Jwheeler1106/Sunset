Twelth assignment for CSC 285

Sunset App Ver 1.0
---
Property Animation

## Objectives:
This week's lab is aimed at familiarizing yourselves with animation. You are going to create a new app called Sunset that shows a scene of the sun in the sky and will animate the sunset when pressed.

## Overview:
In this lab, you will create a new Repository in your GitHub CSC-285 organization account and name it **Sunset-UserName**. You will start building a new application named Sunset in Android Studio. This app will show a scene of the sun in the sky. When you press on the scene, it will animate the sun down below the horizon, and the sky will chnage colors like a sunset.

## Implementation Notes:
1. Create a new GitHub Repository for your Sunset app named CSC-285/Sunset-yourUserName
